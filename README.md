DungeonGame
===========

A simple dungeon crawler I've been working on.

In order to compile this game, use the included jar files and make sure that the compiler has access to the dlls specific to your system.

dungeon.DungeonGame should be set as the main class for the project.

This sample was programmed in Java 7 with JUnit 4 for unit testing.  Both are required to properly compile.
